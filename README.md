10 mins
Created Server Solution 
Created Client Solution

20mins
Implemented server listening and client connecting
Having strange linking error, seems to be to do with the network library being set up wrong
in project settings but can't figure out why it's not wokring. Added networking library to 
linker dependencies but still not working

60mins
Fixed Linker issue, dependencies were only set in release mode not debug.
Successful client server connection with server version still wokring with no client connected.

120mins
switched to implementing space invaders that runs in paralell with breakout for cool hybrid
game. The game currently has a bunch of errors after I implemented player shooting and it's 
making me feel really dumb. Submission is due so submitting as is with compile errors but I'm
gonna go back and finish this cause it could be cool.
